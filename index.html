      <h2><i class="fa fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
      <p>With over seven years of experience in commercial management, I have decided to redirect my professional career towards the dynamic tech industry.
         My passion for software platforms and technological innovation drives me to seek new challenges and opportunities in this field.
         I possess solid experience in manual testing, complemented by a deep understanding of test automation using Cypress and Playwright.
        My proficiency in Cypress allows me to create robust and efficient user interface tests, 
        ensuring the quality and functionality of modern web applications. With Playwright, 
        I expand my capabilities to perform cross-platform testing, covering browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari,
        which ensures comprehensive coverage across various environments.
        <p> These tools allow me to automate complex scenarios,
        optimize execution times, and improve accuracy in error detection.
        In addition to my experience in automated testing, I have basic knowledge of programming languages, 
        which enables me to understand and collaborate effectively with development teams. 
        My main strengths lie in my ability to set clear and achievable goals, my adaptability to change,
         and my constant focus on achieving results. I excel in effective communication and teamwork, 
         essential skills for collaborating on multidisciplinary projects and ensuring success in agile and dynamic environments.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/marbhg/e2e-cypress-quiz" target="_blank">Automation</a> -E2E Cypress Braingle</h3>
      <p> This project is designed to perform end-to-end (E2E) tests for the Braingle. It automates testing across both desktop and mobile browsers to ensure a 
        high-quality user experience. The tests are executed weekly as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline
         to detect issues early. These tests cover key user flows and functionalities, validating the website‚Äôs reliability and performance.
         </p>
         <p>A highlight of this project was the implementation of advanced selectors in Cypress. 
          I used selectors such as contains to locate elements by their text content,
           ensuring accuracy in identifying dynamic elements. Additionally, I employed selectors by id and class for precise and
            efficient identification of unique elements and groups of elements, respectively.
          Element selection by attribute was fundamental for interacting with elements that share specific characteristics,
           such as input types or roles. Parent/child relationship filters allowed me to navigate and select elements based on
            their hierarchy in the DOM, which was essential for testing complex and nested components.
         Finally, first and last element filters were used to select specific elements within lists or collections,
          optimizing the creation of tests for scenarios where the order of elements is relevant.</p>
